    <h1>About:</h1>
    <p>A restaurant is a place where cooked food is sold to the public,and where people sit down to eat it.It is also a place where people go to enjoy the time and to eat a meal.Some restaurants are a chain, meaning that there are restaurants which have
        the same name and serve the same food. <b>McDonald's, Burger King</b> and <b>Pizza Hut</b> are examples of chain restaurants that are all over the world. These restaurants serve
        <t style="color: blue;">fast food</t>, that is, inexpensive food, prepared and served quickly. At some, you do not have to even get out of the car to eat. You can pay and get your order from a window. These places are called
        <t style="color: blue;">drive throughs</t>. There are also chain restaurants that serve slightly more expensive food. They are called
        <t style="color: blue;">fast casual restaurants</t>. Applebee's and Perkins are examples of this type of chain restaurant. Haute cuisine or 'fine dining' is found in a guide, such as the Michelin Guide, the most famous restaurant guide in the world. Their 3-star rosettes
        are given only to restaurants with the highest standards of cooking and service. Interestingly, the Guide gives more 3-stars to Tokyo and Kyoto than to Paris, London and New York together.Traditionally, the restaurants of top hotels such as the
        Hotel de Paris in Monte Carlo or the HÃ´tel Ritz Paris were the main places recognized for fine dining. Today, most Michelin Guide restaurants are separate establishments.</p>

    <p>If you are looking for a standard restaurant website then you must be visit my site, Site <b>"F r e s h and D e l i c i o u s"</b> is an Indian food site where you will get most of indian food. Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and
        traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent. Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available

        <t style="color: blue;">herbs</t>,

        <t style="color: blue;">fruits</t>. </p>
    <p>Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular
        <t style="color: blue;">Hinduism</t>, cultural choices and traditions.Centuries of Islamic rule, particularly by the Mughals, also introduced dishes like
        <t style="color: blue;">samosa </t>and
        <t style="color: blue;">pilaf</t>.</p>
    <p>Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these
        such as
        <t style="color: blue;"> potatoes </t>,
        <t style="color: blue;">tomatoes</t>,
        <t style="color: blue;">chillies</t>,
